 Hailo Application Code Examples 
A set of stand-alone canned examples for compiling NN models and exercising different tasks on Hailo devices.


Under the `runtime` directory you would find
* Examples for using different coding languages (Python, c, c#, c++) and performs different tasks
* Each example was tested on the specified environment
* The README for that example would highlight any external dependancy
* Rich GStreamer pipelines, including BASH and c++ implementations
* Specific platform guides (e.g. TDA4)

Under the `model_compilation` directory you would find
* Examples for converting a naitve mode in ONNX or tflite formats to Hailo executable - HEF
* Complete optimization flow, including quantization

Under the `resources` directory you would find
