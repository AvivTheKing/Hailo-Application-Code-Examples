**Last HailoRT version checked - 4.14.0**

This is a Cross Compilation Yolov8 C++ Detection example for H15.

The example does the following:

1. Cross Compiles the CPP example for H15
2. 
2. Reads the network configuration from a yolov5\yolov7 HEF file
3. Prepares the application for inference
4. Runs inference and postprocess on a given video file 
5. Draws the detection boxes on the original video
6. Prints the object detected + confidence to the screen
5. Prints statistics

NOTE: Currently supports only devices connected on a PCIe link.


### Prequisites ###
- H15 cross development toolchain (Generated by toolchain shell script under release/prebuild/sdk/ in the Vision_Processor_SW_Package)
- H15 platform for executing, containing OpenCV 4.5.5
This demo was tested on H15 EVB with Vision_Processor_SW_Package_2023_07.tar.gz
- CMake >= 3.11

### Usage ###

1. On the development machine, compile the example by running `./build.sh` and providing the toolchain folder location
2. Get the required resources by running `./get_resources.sh`
3. On the H15 platform create a dir called `yolov8_example`
4. Copy the compiled binary and the downloaded resources from the development machine to the H15 yolov8_example dir.
 
   `scp build/aarch64/yolov8_cross_compilation_h15 root@10.0.0.1:~/yolov8_example/`
   `scp resources/images/bus.jpg root@10.0.0.1:~/yolov8_example/`
   `scp resources/hefs/h15/yolov8s_h15.hef root@10.0.0.1:~/yolov8_example/`
5. Run the example on the H15 machine - ./yolov8_cross_compilation_h15 -input=bus.jpg -hef=yolov8s_h15.hef -num=30
6. The example will infer the bus.jpg frame 30 times, and generate an output file `output.jpg`
7. copy the file back to the development machine to view the bounding boxes

NOTE: There should be no spaces between "=" given in the command line arguments and the file name itself.
